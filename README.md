### What is it?
This is an eclectic collection of study plans, resources and interview questions that will help you in cracking Machine Learning interviews. It will be helpful to someone who is interested in applying for one/more of the following positions in the Machine Learning group of a leading company (Google, Facebook, IBM, Amazon, etc.):

1. Research Engineer
1. Software Engineer
1. Postdoctoral Researcher
1. Research Scientist
1. Data Scientist

I created this repo when I was interviewing for various companies after my graduate studies and it was immensely helpful. 

### Why use it?
This will be useful to someone who is:

- Interested in a multi-month study plan to prepare for Machine Learning interviews
- Preparing for Machine Learning interviews, however, is lost in the plethora of resources and wants to prioritize what to learn. 
- Looking to hone their skills by attempting some prospective interview questions  

To the best of my knowledge, this repo is the only place that takes a thorough yet efficient approach to Machine Learning interview preparation.

### What should I learn?
Someone applying to any one of the above positions is expected to know basics of the following broad topics:

- Computer Science
- Linear Algbera
- Statistics and Probability
- Machine Learning

All of these are fairly broad topics and sections dedicated to them in this repo will tell you the specific concepts you should know about. Note that deeper knowledge of one/more of the above topics might be expected of you depending on the particular position you are interviewing for. This raises our next question. 

### What is expected of me in the interviews?

**Research or Software Engineer:** If you are applying to any one of these positions in a Machine Learning group, you should know the basics of the above four topics with emphasis on Computer Science and Machine Learning. In addition, some projects on Machine Learning in GitHub will be helpful to showcase both your knowledge and coding skills.

**Postdoctoral Researcher and Research Scientist:** Apart from the basics, you should know extremely well about one domain of Machine Learning. You should have published multiple papers in this domain. This will demonstrate your authority in this topic. Since you are applying to this position you already know what that would be for your case. For example, in my case this topic was Deep Learning. 

**Data Scientist:** If you are interested in a Data Scientist position, then after learning the basics, please emphasize more on Statistics and Probability.
