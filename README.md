## Machine Learning Interview University

### What is it?
This is an eclectic collection of study plans, resources and interview questions that will help you in cracking Machine Learning interviews. It will be helpful to someone who is interested in applying for one/more of the following positions in the Machine Learning group of a leading company (Google, Facebook, IBM, Amazon, etc.):

1. Research Engineer
1. Software Engineer
1. Postdoctoral Researcher
1. Research Scientist
1. Data Scientist

I created this repo when I was interviewing for various companies after my graduate studies and it was immensely helpful. 

### Why use it?
This will be useful to someone who is:

- Interested in a multi-month study plan to prepare for Machine Learning interviews
- Preparing for Machine Learning interviews, however, is lost in the plethora of resources and wants to prioritize what to learn. 
- Looking to hone their skills by attempting some prospective interview questions  

To the best of my knowledge, this repo is the only place that takes a thorough yet efficient approach to Machine Learning interview preparation.

### What should I learn?
Someone applying to any one of the above positions is expected to know basics of the following broad topics:

- Computer Science
- Linear Algbera
- Statistics and Probability
- Machine Learning

Note that deeper knowledge of one/more of the above topics might be expected of you depending on the particular position you are interviewing for. This will be discussed in the next section.
