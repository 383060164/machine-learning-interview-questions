# Mathematics - List of questions

## Linear Algebra
1. What is broadcasting in connection to Linear Algebra?
1. What is a tensor?
1. If inverse of a matrix exists, how to calculate it?
1. What is the determinant of a square matrix? How is it calculated (Laplace expansion)? What is the connection of determinant to eigenvalues?
1. Discuss span and linear dependence.
1. What is Ax = b? When does Ax =b has a unique solution? 
1. In Ax = b, what happens when A is fat or tall?
1. What is a norm? What is L1, L2 and L infinity norm?
1. What are the conditions a norm has to satisfy?
1. Why is squared of L2 norm preferred in ML than just L2 norm?
1. When L1 norm is preferred over L2 norm?
1. Can the number of nonzero elements in a vector be defined as L0 norm? If no, why?
1. What is Frobenius norm?
1. What is an orthogonal matrix? Why is computationally preferred? (a square matrix whose rows are mutually orthonormal and columns are mutually orthonormal.)
1. What is eigendecomposition, eigenvectors and eigenvalues?
1. How to find eigen values of a matrix?
1. Write the eigendecomposition formala for a matrix. If the matrix is real symmetric, how will this change?
1. What are positive definite, negative definite, positive semi definite and negative semi definite matrices?
1. What is SVD? Why do we use it? Why not just use ED?
1. Given A, how will you calculate its SVD?
1. What are singular values, left singulars and right singulars?
1. What is the Moore Penrose pseudo inverse and how to calculate it?
1. If we do Moore Penrose pseudo inverse on Ax = b, what solution is provided is A is fat? Moreover, what solution is provided if A is tall?
1. Which matrices can be decomposed by ED? (Any NxN square matrix with N linearly independent eigenvectors)
1. Which matrices can be decomposed by SVD? (Any matrix; V is either conjugate transpose or normal transpose depending on whether A is complex or real)
1. What is the trace of a matrix?
1. What is the trace of a scalar?
1. Write the frobenius norm of a matrix in terms of trace?
